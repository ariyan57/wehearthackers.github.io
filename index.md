The #WeHeartHackers Project is a collaborative movement between the medical device and security researcher communities.

By signing this pledge, organizations state their intent to work collaboratively with security researchers at the [Biohacking Village](https://www.villageb.io/) at DEF CON 2019 (Aug 8-11). Learn more through our [open invitation](/assets/documents/BHVinvitation.pdf) to work together in good faith, in the best interest of patients, when researching, disclosing, and addressing security issues.
