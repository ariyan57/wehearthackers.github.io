The #WeHeartHackers Project is a collaborative movement between the medical device and security researcher communities.

The [Biohacking Village](https://www.villageb.io/) welcomes all those who act in good faith, in the best interest of patients, when researching, disclosing, and addressing security issues. By signing this pledge, organizations state their intent to join our [open invitation](/assets/documents/BHVinvitation.pdf) to work collaboratively with security researchers at DEF CON 2019 (Aug 8-11).
